High-Level Attack Flow (JADE SPIDER - Azuki Scenario)

1. Initial Access
   - Attacker connects via RDP from 10.0.8.9 to azuki-sl.
   - Uses valid credentials for user 'kenji.sato'.

2. Execution
   - Attacker creates and runs PowerShell script 'wupdate.ps1'.
   - Script appears to automate later stages (AV exclusion, downloads, etc.).

3. Defense Evasion
   - Windows Defender exclusions are added to avoid scanning staged tools.
   - Tools and data are stored in C:\ProgramData\WindowsCache.
   - Event logs (Security, System, Application) are cleared near the end.

4. Credential Access
   - Attacker downloads mm.exe into the staging directory.
   - mm.exe executes a Mimikatz-like module: sekurlsa::logonpasswords.
   - LSASS credentials are dumped for further use.

5. Persistence
   - Local account 'support' is created via net.exe/net1.exe.
   - support is added to the Local Administrators group, acting as a backdoor.

6. Collection & Exfiltration
   - Sensitive data is collected and compressed into export-data.zip.
   - curl.exe is used to send the ZIP archive to a Discord webhook over HTTPS.

7. Lateral Movement Attempt
   - cmdkey.exe stores credentials for 10.1.0.188.
   - mstsc.exe /v:10.1.0.188 is used to attempt an RDP connection.
   - Indicates attempt to pivot deeper into the environment.
